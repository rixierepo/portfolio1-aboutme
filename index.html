          <p class="desc pt-2">
            My name is Richo Malvin, a freelancer in hardware engineering and
            programming especially in microcontroller devices that use the
            arduino programming language such as Arduino boards, Espressif,
            stm32, and similar products. I have been interested in electronics
            since childhood but only as a hobby. I have a background in computer
            and network engineering when I entered vocational high school, and
            that's where I got this expertise. When I entered college, my
            interest in hardware engineering reboosted maybe because I took part
            in robotics student activities, and that's where for the first time
            I know what is Arduino, how Arduino works, how to program Arduino,
            how to make automation devices, robots, etc. I think my skills and
            background maybe can be combined, hardware and computer network. Now
            these two technologies are combined with another technologies and
            born a new revolutionary things called <b>Internet of Things</b>.

          <p class="desc pt-2">
            I am a 2022 graduate of Informatics Engineering Study Program, Banyuwangi State Polytechnic, Indonesia. I have several experiences during my study period approximately for 3 years. I actively and enthusiastically participate in robotics student activities because I like things related to electronics and computers such as robots, automation products, smart devices, and similar things. I also hold a position that is quite important for the robotics activity group. I have participated in a national level robot competition, namely the Indonesian thematic robot contest in 2020 together with 2 of my friends. The robot that we are contesting is a medical robot that can lift Covid-19 patients without human touch.
          </p>
          <p class="desc pt-2">I also participated in the activities of the assisted village grant program in 2020, where I and 9 other members made a tool that can dry batik cloth and can be controlled and monitored using a web application in real time.</p>

          <p class="desc pt-2">in 2022 I took part in the student creativity program. The program is an activity which we serve partners by creating a technological innovation that can solve problems experienced by partners. Me and 4 other members created an automatic luggage locker technology using an RFID scanning system.</p>
